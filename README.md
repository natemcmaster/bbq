BBQ - Mini Angular
------

BBQ was created under a the academic prohibition on using Angular. So I made this light framework to imitate the most useful parts of [Angular](http://angularjs.org).

I've published it here not because I believe you should use this in production, but rather to show that Angular is not magic -- even an undergrad can create a simple MVC web framework.
